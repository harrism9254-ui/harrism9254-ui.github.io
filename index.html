 <p>The Philadelphia Eagles are a professional American football team based in Philadelphia. The Eagles compete in the National Football League as a member of the National Football Conference East division. The team plays its home games at Lincoln Financial Field in the South Philadelphia Sports Complex. The franchise was established in 1933 as a replacement for the bankrupt Frankford Yellow Jackets when a group led by Bert Bell secured the rights to an NFL franchise in Philadelphia. Since their formation, the Eagles have appeared in the playoffs 31 times, won 16 division titles, appeared in four pre-merger NFL Championship Games, winning three of them, and appeared in five Super Bowls, winning Super Bowls LII and LIX.</p>
